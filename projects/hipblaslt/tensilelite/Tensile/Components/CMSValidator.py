    Ensure that the Packs start and end at the correct indices.
    The pack commands take the data loaded into registers by LR commands and manipulate it in various ways to prepare it for the VMFMA instructions.

    There are several restrictions placed on Pack instructions:
    1. For all gemm types (tf32, bf16, etc.) the Pack instructions must be issued after the data is guaranteed to be loaded into the registers (guaranteed by SWaitCnt instructions). And they must finish before the first VMFMA that uses their results.
    2. For fp32 GEMMs, there are additional restrictions on:
        1. The ordering of the Pack instructions.
        2. The minimum number of quad-cycles that must pass between issuing certain pack instructions and when their results get used. These restrictions are defined in section 7.6 of the CDNA 4 ISA.

    Context and example: There will be a sequence of N 'GRIncA' instructions
    for incrementing the memory address that the A macro tile is read from.
    The CMS developer has the freedom to insert these N instructions into
    'vmfmaIndices' of their choice. A vmfma_index is a sequence of instructions between
    2 consecutive mfma instructions. Example: 'GRIncA' : [[0,1,1,3]] would
    mean that the N=4 instructions to increment the pointer appear as follows:

    instruction 1    : between mfma 0 and mfma 1.
    instructions 2,3 : between mfma 1 and mfma 2.
    instruction 4    : between mfma 3 and mfma 4.

    However, there is a correctness requirement that the N vmfmaIndices for these
    instructions are non-decreasing. This rule is true for all groups of instructions,
